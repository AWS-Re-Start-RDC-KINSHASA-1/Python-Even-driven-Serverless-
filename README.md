# Python-Even-driven-Serverless-
This project aims to showcase the usage of Python in event-driven and serverless environments, particularly with AWS Lambda.
Event-driven and serverless environments offer an agile and cost-effective approach to developing and deploying applications. Python, with its support for asynchronous functions and seamless integration with cloud services, is a powerful choice for building these applications.

This repository contains examples of AWS Lambda functions written in Python that respond to various events triggered by AWS services such as S3, DynamoDB, SNS, and many more. Each example comes with its own README describing the trigger event, how the Lambda function operates, and instructions for deployment.
